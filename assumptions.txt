A few assumptions were made, both via discussions with memebers of the team, or by myself during development of this project. I have listed them here.

- Price can be formatted to match the desired format of #.##
- There can not be duplicate products with the same 'name'
- produce_code is not to be passed in and instead generated by the server running the app
- I did not add a 'publish docker container' step in Github Actions. If this were a live app that we wished to deploy, I could/would have.
    - I do build and run the container and run the integration tests against it
